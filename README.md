## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Developers

- **Dates**: The resume lists a current job starting in **January 2025**. For the live website, this should be updated to the correct current date (e.g., "January 2024 ‚Äì Present") to maintain credibility.  
- **Certificates**: The certificates are dated **June 2025**, which is in the future. These dates should be verified and corrected before going live.  
- **Awards Note**: The *"Engineering Excellence"* award from *Borcelle Technologies* seems incongruous with her Economics background. This should be clarified or verified for accuracy.  
- **Design**: Use a **clean, modern design** with a professional color scheme (navy blue, grey, white).  
- **Responsiveness**: The site must be fully **responsive** for mobile and tablet devices.
